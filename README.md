# Fabrication of Freestanding and Flexible Supercapacitor Electrodes Based on MXene-Polymer Electrospun

Flexible electrodes that are fractions of a millimeter in thickness can be used in a variety of applications in fields ranging from energy storage to brain electrodes and electrocatalysis. Among these, energy storage is probably the most important and obvious application. In particular, supercapacitors have attracted significant research interest for small and portable electronic devices due to their high-power densities and high charging and discharging rates.Due to the excellent conductivity, high electrochemical activity, and high specific surface area of 2D transition metal carbides and nitrides (MXenes), there is much interest in developing MXene fibers for smart textile applications, including energy storage devices for powering wearable electronics. In this research, the fabrication of freestanding and flexible supercapacitor electrode was achieved via electrospinning of two dimensional $Ti_3C_2T_x$ MXene and polymer mixture on stainless steel. After that, several tests were performed to illustrate the impact of the ratio of used materials and to obtain the best result. These tests include Cyclic Voltammetry (CV) and lifetime tests, Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy (EIS), and charge-discharge cycle tests on the electospun electrodes.




## Electrospinning Setup:

As it can be seen in the following photos, our setup for electrospinning contains Arduino board, motor drivers, a 12 V power supply for the board and drivers, motors, etc. to force drops of the electrospinning solution to come out of the syringe. Then, due to the electric potential between the tip of the syringe and collector (stainless steel) provided by a high voltage power supply, the drops will be spun and lie on the surface of the stainless steel
